Crappy Vigènere cipher Kasiski examination in Rust

It should do it's job correctly at Kasiski examination, but it can certainly be optimized and improved upon.

I'm still a beginner at Rust, and this was made in a rather short amount of time for fun, thus don't expect the code to be anything good.
I'll happily take advice though, but this is most likely not going to receive more commits.

## Vigènere cipher
The Vigènere cipher is very similar to the Caesar cipher, and behaves almost exactly like one except for the multi-character key.
